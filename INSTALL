COFFI is a header-only C++ library - installation does not require any (pre)compilation step.
Just copy 'coffi' folder into standard include directory.

For example:
    cp -R coffi /usr/include

Alternatively, it is possible to modify compiler's include search path -
'-I<dir>' option in GCC; '/I<dir>' in MSVC.

Makefile(s) that come with the distribution package are provided for example files and tests compilation only.

To compile the examples, use the commands below:
    autoreconf -f -i
    ./configure
    make

To compile and run the tests, use the commands below:
    cd tests
    autoreconf -f -i
    ./configure
    make check
